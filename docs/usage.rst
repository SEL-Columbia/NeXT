Use Cases
=========

The following are the initial envisioned use cases for the NeXT spatial analysis tool.

Create Scenario
---------------

#. From the index view, navigate to create-scenario view.

#. Upload 2 (csv?) files:

  #. Facilities (x, y)
  #. Population (x, y, count)

#. Assign a name to the scenario and save it.

#. This runs the scenario and brings the user to the show-scenario view.

View Scenario
-------------

#. From the index view, select the scenario to view (brings the user to the show-scenario view).

#. The show-scenario view displays the map of the Facilities and Population along with the "Households within Distance to Facility" graph.

Add Facility [Future]
---------------------

#. From the show-scenario view, user adds a facility to the map via mouse-click. 

#. The scenario is re-run and the view is refreshed with an updated map and graph.
